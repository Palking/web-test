                    <h3>This website</h3>
                    <p> I made this site simply to toy around with various aspects of web-development
                        to give myself some practice in the HTML/CSS/JS stack as well as some jquery.
                        I might add a C# web API based backend in the near future in order to learn 
                        about the whole GET/POST-request procedure and hopefully put it to good use 
                        later on.
                    </p>

                        While this website was only meant for learning purposes in the beginning, i might
                        actually turn it to something like a blog / personal CV as long as i find enough 
                        content to populate the pages nicely.
