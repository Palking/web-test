                    <h3>This website</h3>
                    <p> I made this site simply to toy around with various aspects of web-development
                        to give myself some practice in the HTML/CSS/JS stack as well as some jquery.
                        I might add a C# web API based backend in the near future in order to learn 
                        about the whole GET/POST-request procedure and hopefully put it to good use 
                        later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>                       
                        While this website was only meant for learning purposes in the beginning, i might
                        actually turn it to something like a blog / personal CV as long as i find enough 
                        content to populate the pages nicely.

                    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was my very first, small project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I made it over the course of a weekend using my small knowledge of Javascript and
                        HTML i had at the time. I was using tables with X / O's as the playfield and 
                        alert boxes for the input using numbers 1 - 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the code itself was terrible (duh), i was still happy to complete my first
                        project and it felt like a breakthrough for me.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Top-Down-Tiles</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind the game was to create a small, 2D game using C# with the MonoDevelop
                        framework. <br>
                        It was supposed to be a simple RPG with only core features like levelups and weapons 
                        implemented. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I stopped working on it, because i was unhappy with my solutions for collision detection
                        and started to like Unity a lot more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main features i had implemented where the movement (8 direction based), firing some
                        projectiles as well as collision with obstacles constructed by using a tile based map,
                        that is generated by using different tile types and an array to contain the level
                        information. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My main 'non-game'-project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is currently the project that i spent the most time working on and is still far from 
                        finished. <br>
                        The finished solution is supposed to be a website for sharing and storing recipes. <br>
                        This will make use of my raspberry pi to host both the data containing the information
                        (currently in plain .txt files, will probably suffice) as well as hosting the web API
                        including the whole backend logic like input checking and so on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The backend is written in C#, the website will be either in .NET's MVC or, more likely,
                        with the pure HTML/CSS/JS/jquery stack using requests to the API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When all of those basic functions are working, i plan to also make 
                        a android application for a more convinient experience as well as a dashboard using my 
                        pi for the kitchen.
